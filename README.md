# Math-Basics-Time-Complexity
A curated collection of beginner to intermediate level math-based programming problems and time complexity fundamentals for coding interview prep. Covers prime numbers, GCD/LCM, Armstrong numbers, digit operations, and complexity analysis.

# Math Basics + Time Complexity üìäüßÆ

This repository is a collection of beginner to intermediate programming problems focused on **Math fundamentals** and **Time Complexity concepts**. It serves as a solid starting point for anyone preparing for coding interviews or sharpening their problem-solving skills.

## üìö Topics Covered
- Arithmetic and Number Theory
- Prime Numbers and Divisors
- Digit Manipulation
- GCD and LCM
- Armstrong and Palindromic Numbers
- Table Printing and String-Based Math
- Time Complexity (MCQs and Theory)

## üß† Purpose
These problems are hand-picked from **GeeksforGeeks**, **LeetCode**, and **InterviewBit**. The idea is to:
- Build strong fundamentals in math-based logic.
- Understand the time and space complexity of simple to moderate algorithms.
- Practice through implementation-based and conceptual problems.
