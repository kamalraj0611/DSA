# DSA 🚀  
A well-organized and topic-wise collection of Data Structures and Algorithms problems solved in **Java**.

This repository is a continuous learning journey focused on mastering problem-solving using Java with real-world examples from platforms like [GeeksforGeeks](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/) and [LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/).
