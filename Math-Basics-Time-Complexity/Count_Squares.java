Given a positive integer n, find the number of perfect squares that are less than n in the sample space of perfect squares. The sample space consists of all perfect squares starting from 1 (i.e., 1, 4, 9, 16, 25, …)

Examples :

Input: n = 9
Output: 2
Explanation: 1 and 4 are the only Perfect Squares less than 9. So, the Output is 2.
Input: n = 3
Output: 1
Explanation: 1 is the only Perfect Square less than 3. So, the Output is 1.
Constraints:
1 <= n <= 108

Expected Complexities
Time Complexity: sqrt(n)
Auxiliary Space: O(1)*/

class Solution {
    static int countSquares(int n) {
        // code here
        int count = 0;
        for(int i = 1; i*i <n; i++)
        {
            count++;
        }
        return count;
    }
}
